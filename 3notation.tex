\section{Solution sets and notation}\label{not}
The previous chapter leads to the following initial value problem (IVP). \underline{What is $u$?} Another important identity is achieved by integrating the IVP over $r$. \underline{The solution sets are disjoint.}
\begin{gather*}-u''(r)-\frac{N-1}{r}u'(r)=g(u(r))\tag{IVP}\label{ivp}\\ u(0)=\alpha,~u'(0)=0\end{gather*}
