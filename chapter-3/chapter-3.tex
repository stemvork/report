\section{Sturm theory and related lemmata}
The paper by Genoud refers to the paper by Kwong, which contains a recap of some
Sturmian theory. In particular, the main Sturm comparison theorem and certain
corollaries, as well as the concept of a \emph{disconjugay interval}.

Important theory for the following lemmata is Sturm Comparison theorem as stated
and proven in for example \cite{kwong}.


\begin{theorem}
    Let $U$ and $V$ be solutions, respectively, of the following equations
    \be \label{sturm:uivp}
        U''(x) + f(x) U'(x) + g(x) U(x) = 0,\quad x \in (a, b),
    \ee
    \be \label{sturm:vivp}
        V''(x) + f(x) V'(x) + G(x) V(x) = 0,\quad x \in (a, b),
    \ee
    
    where $f, g$ and $G$ are continuos. Let $(\mu, \nu)$ be a subinterval in
    which $V(x) \neq 0$ and $U(x) \neq 0$, and in which the comparison condition 
    \be \label{sturm:compare}
        G(x) \geq g(x) \quad \text{for all} ~ x \in (\mu, \nu)
    \ee
    
    holds. Suppose further that
    \be \label{sturm:majorleft}
        \frac{V'(\mu)}{V(\mu)} \leq \frac{U'(\mu)}{U(\mu)}.
    \ee

    Then
    \be \label{sturm:majorx}
        \frac{V'(x)}{V(x)} \leq \frac{U'(x)}{U(x)}\quad \text{for all} ~ x \in
        (\mu, \nu).
    \ee

    Equality in \eqref{sturm:majorx} can occur only if $U \equiv V$ in $[\mu,
    x]$. If either $\mu$ or $\nu$ is a zero of $U$ or $V$, then the fractions in
    \eqref{sturm:majorleft} and \eqref{sturm:majorx} are interpreted as
    $\infty$. 

\end{theorem}

%      MARK CONCLUSION
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
{\red In the end, we wish to show that the function $\za$ is monotone decreasing in
$\a$. Or actually, that $(\a, \a+\e)\subset N$ and if $\bar{\a}\in N$ then $\za :
[\bar{\a}, \infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is monotone decreasing.}

\section{Basic properties of solutions}
In this section, we will derive several more basic properties of solutions to
\eqref{genuivp}. In particular, we will find an initial condition $\a_p$ that
separates solutions into $\a \in P$ and $\a \in G \cup N$. Next, we will find
that solutions with $\a \in G \cup N$ are strictly decreasing everywhere.
Lastly, we will find that the derivative with respect to the initial condition
$w(r)$ has at least one zero in the interval $(0, \za)$. 

\begin{lemma}\label{genlem1}%\label{lya}
Suppose that $V(0):=\underset{r\to0}{\lim}~V(r)$ exists and is finite. Then
\[ 0<\alpha<\left[\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}
\right]^{1/(p-1)}\implies \alpha\in P. \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We define the Lyapunov (or energy) function $E(r)$ as
\be \label{lyadef} 
E(r) \coloneqq \frac{1}{2}u'(r)^2
-\frac{\lambda}{2} u(r)^2 + \frac{1}{p+1} V(r) u(r)^{p+1} 
\ee

for 
\[
\begin{dcases}
    r \in [0, \infty) \quad \text{if} ~ \a \in P \cup G,\\ 
    r \in [0, \za] \quad \text{if} ~ \a \in N.  
\end{dcases}
\]

We calculate the derivative $E'(r)$ and gather the terms with $u'(r)$
\[ E'(r) = \left[u''(r)-\lambda u(r)+V(r)u(r)^p\right]u'(r)
+ \frac{1}{p+1} V'(r)u(r)^{p+1}. \]

This expression can be simplified by writing the IVP \eqref{genuivp} as
\[ -\frac{1}{r}u'(r)=\left[u''(r)-\lambda u(r)+V(r)u(r)^p\right]. \]

Thus, we have
\be \label{lyadev} 
E'(r) = -\frac{u'(r)^2}{r} + \frac{1}{p+1} V'(r)u(r)^{p+1} \leq 0,
\ee

where $E'(r)\leq 0$ holds because $V' \leq 0$ by \eqref{vh2} and 
\be \label{upos}
\begin{dcases}
    u(r) > 0 \quad \text{on} ~ [0, \infty) \quad \text{if} ~ \a \in P \cup G \\
    u(r) \geq 0 \quad \text{on} [0,\za] \quad \text{if} ~ \a \in N.
\end{dcases}
\ee

For $\a \in N$, we have $u(\za) = 0$. We evaluate $E(\za)$ {\red for $\a \in N$}
\be \label{eza}
E(\za) = \half u'(\za)^2 \geq 0. 
\ee

For $\a \in G$, we have 
\[ 
    u(r) \to 0 \quad \text{and} \quad  u'(r) \to 0 
    \quad \text{as} ~ r \to \infty.
\]
Hence, we have $E(r) \to 0$ as $r \to \infty$. 
Then by \eqref{lyadev}, we have 
\be \label{epos} E(r)\geq 0 \quad \text{for} ~ \a \in G \cup N.  \ee

In particular, we have 
\be \label{e0sep}
\begin{dcases}
    E(0) \geq 0 \quad \text{for} ~ \a \in G \cup N \\
    E(0) < 0 \quad \text{for} ~ \a \in P.
\end{dcases}
\ee
% On the other hand, if $E(0) < 0$, we have $\a \in P$. 

We will solve $E(0) < 0$ for $\a$, where we remember that $u(0, \a) = \a > 0$
\[ 
    E(0) = \half u'(0)^2 - \frac{\lambda}{2} \a^2
    + \frac{1}{p+1} V(0) \a^{p+1} < 0. 
\]

{\red actually, $(ru') = 0$ "in" $r=0$. WRONG: We use $u'(0)=0$ and $u(0)=\a$ to
    simplify the expression to
\[ 
    E(0) = -\frac{\lambda}{2}\alpha^2 + 
    \frac{1}{p+1} V(0)\alpha^{p+1} = 0. 
\]}

So that we obtain 
\[
\a < \left[\left( \frac{p+1}{2}\right) \frac{\lambda}{V(0)}
\right]^{\tfrac{1}{p-1}} .
\]


\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%      MARK LEMMA 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}\label{genlem2}
Let $\alpha \in G \cup N$, and $u(r) = u(r, \a)$. Then $u'(r) < 0$ for all
$r \in (0, z(\alpha))$ and $u'(z(\alpha)) < 0$ if $\alpha \in N$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
By \eqref{epos} and \eqref{e0sep}, we have $E(r) \geq 0$ and $E(0) \geq 
0$ for $\a \in G \cup N$. By the IVP, we have for $r=0$, where $u(0, \a) = \a >
0$
\[ u''(0) + \underset{r \downarrow 0}{\lim} \frac{1}{r} u'(r) -
\lambda \a + V(0) \a^p = 0. \]

{\red If $V(0) < \infty$ then ...

If $V(0) = \infty$ then ...}

Then there exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $u''(r, \a) < 0$ for $r \in (0,
\epsilon)$ and we have
\[ u'(\epsilon, \a) = \int_0^\epsilon u''(s, \a) ds < 0. \]

We claim that $u'(r, \a) < 0$ for all $r > 0$. Suppose by contradiction that
there exists $r_0 \in (0,\za)$ such that $u'(r_0, \a)=0$. Then by
\eqref{genuivp} we have 
\be \label{ivpdev0} 
u''(r_0, \a) - \lambda u(r_0, \a) + V(r_0) u(r_0)^p = 0. 
\ee

Since $u'(r, \a) < 0$ on $(0, r_0)$, we have $u''(r_0, \a) \geq 0$. 
Solving for $u''(r_0, \a)$ in \eqref{ivpdev0} 
\[ \lambda u(r_0,\a) - V(r_0) u(r_0,\a)^p = u''(r_0, \a) \geq 0, \]

where we can solve for $u(r_0, \a)$ to find that
\[ u(r_0, \a) \leq \left[ \frac{\lambda}{V(0)} \right]^{\tfrac{1}{p-1}} <
\left[ \frac{p+1}{2} \frac{\lambda}{V(0)} \right]^{\tfrac{1}{p-1}}. \]

Now this implies by {\red or \eqref{lyadef}} Lemma \ref{genlem1} that $E(r_0) <
0$, which contradicts \eqref{epos}. Therefore, we have $u'(r) < 0$ for all $r
\in (0, \za)$. {\red short?} Lastly, if we have $u'(\za) = 0$ for $\a \in N$, we have $u
\equiv 0$. Hence, we have $u'(\za) < 0$.

\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%      MARK LEMMA 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}\label{genlem3}
Let $\alpha\in (G\cup N).$ Then $w(r)=w(r,\a)$ has at least one zero in $(0,z(\alpha))$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The cases $\a\in N$ and $\a\in G$ will be considered seperately. First, we
suppose $\a\in N$. We write $u(r) = u(r, \a)$. The differential equations for
$u$ and $w$ can be written as:
\begin{gather}
\label{c3:livp}  (ru'(r))'+r\left[-\lambda u(r)+V(r)u(r)^p\right]=0\\
\label{c3:lwvp}  (rw'(r))'+r\left[-\lambda w(r)+pV(r)u(r)^{p-1}w(r)\right]=0.
\end{gather}

% The Lagrange identity for \eqref{c3:ivp} and \eqref{c3:wvp} will yield
% information about the zeroes of $w(r)$. 

We multiply equations \eqref{c3:livp} and \eqref{c3:lwvp} by $w(r)$ and $u(r)$
respectively and subtract to obtain:
\be \label{uwdiff}
    w(r) (ru'(r))' - u(r) (rw'(r))' = r \left\{ p V(r) u(r)^p w(r) - 
    V(r) u(r)^p w(r) \right\}.
\ee

Now, we integrate from $0$ to $\za$ to obtain: 
\begin{multline} \label{genlem3longdiff}
  \int_0^{z(\alpha)}w(r)(ru'(r))'-u(r)(rw'(r))'\diff r\\
  = \int_0^{z(\alpha)}r\left\{pV(r)u(r)^pw(r)-V(r)u(r)^pw(r)\right\}\diff r.
\end{multline}

By partial integration, the left hand side reads
\[
w(r) r u'(r) \at_0^{\za} - u(r) r w'(r) \at_0^{\za} 
+ \int_0^{\za} r w'(r) u'(r) \diff r - \int_0^{\za} r u'(r) w'(r) \diff r,
\]

and using $u(\za) = 0$ and $r = 0$, the only term that remains is
\[
    w(\za) \za u'(\za).
\]

Furthermore, the right hand side of \eqref{genlem3longdiff} can be simplified to
\[
    (p-1) \int_0^{\za} r V(r) u(r)^p w(r) \diff r,
\]

such that \eqref{genlem3longdiff} can be simplified to
\be \label{genlem3neq}
w(\za) \za u'(\za) = (p-1) \int_0^{\za} r V(r) u(r)^p w(r) \diff r.
\ee

By Lemma \ref{genlem2}, we have $u'(\za) < 0$. If $w > 0$ holds, then $w(\za) >
0$ and the left hand side of \eqref{genlem3neq} is negative. However, the right
hand side is positive. Hence, $w(\za) < 0$ and $w$ has at least one zero in $(0,
\za)$. 

On the other hand, for $\a \in G$, we assume by contradiction that $w > 0$
on $(0, \infty)$. 
%We will analyse the quantity $\frac{u}{w}$. 
%First, by the quotient rule we can write 
We write
\be
    r \left( u'(r) w(r) - u(r) w'(r) \right)
    = r w(r)^2 \frac{u'(r) w(r) - u(r) w'(r)}{w(r)^2}
    = r w(r)^2 \left( \frac{u}{w} \right)'
\ee

such that \cref{uwdiff} integrated from $0$ to $r$ reads
\be \label{uwli}
r w(r)^2 \left( \frac{u}{w} \right)' = (p-1) \int_0^r s V(s) u(s)^p w(s) ds >0.
\ee

From \eqref{uwli}, we deduce that 
\be \label{uwdev}
    \left( \frac{u}{w} \right)' > 0 \quad \text{for}~ r \in (0, \infty),
    % \quad \text{and} ~
\ee

and combined with $u(0) = \a > 0$ and $w(r) = 1$ from \eqref{genuivp} and
\eqref{genwivp}, we conclude that
\be \label{uwpos}
    \frac{u(r)}{w(r)} > 0 \quad \text{on}~ (0, \infty).
\ee

{\red By several theorems and lemmata in \cite{genthes}, we know that the limit
as r to infinity of \eqref{uwpos} is 0, contradicting \eqref{uwdev}.}

\section{More advanced properties of solutions}
\begin{lemma}\label{genlem4}
Let $\alpha \in G \cup N$. There exist $\beta_0 > 0$ and a unique function
$\sigma : [0, \bar\beta] \to [0, \infty)$ with the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item  $\sigma$ is continuous and decreasing, $\sigma(0) > 0$ and
$\sigma(\bar\beta) = 0$; 
\item for all $\beta > 0$ we have: 
\[
    \phi_\beta(r) < 0 \quad \text{if} ~ r < \sigma(\beta), 
    \quad \text{and} \quad
    \phi_\beta > 0 \quad \text{if} ~ r > \sigma(\beta). 
\]
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We fix $\beta>0$. Then $\phib(r)$ is fixed, as we can see from \eqref{phibdef}
\[ \phib(r) = V(r) u(r)^p \left[ \beta (p-1) - 2 - \xi(r) \right]. \]

Since $V > 0$ by \eqref{vh2} and $u(r)^p > 0$ by \eqref{upos}, the
sign of $\phib$ depends only on the term in brackets. To study how the zero of
this term depends on the choice of $\beta$ as
% \[ 
%     \beta (p-1) - 2 - \xi(r) = 0 
% \]
% 
we will define and analyse the function $\Xi(r)$ 
\[ 
    \beta (p-1) - 2 - \xi(r) = 0 \iff 
    \beta = \frac{2 + \xi(r)}{p - 1} \coloneqq \Xi(r).
\] 
{\red why does $\xi$ have only one zero?
Argument why $\phib$ changes sign only once.}

{\red Then $\sib$ is defined by the zero of $\phib$. Since $\beta$ was arbitrary,
$\sib$ is defined by $\phib$ for all $\beta$ and $\sib$ is unique.  That $\sib$
is continuous and decreasing is shown below.}

%Draw the following: $x$-axis is the $\beta$-axis and goes from 0 to
%$\bar{\beta}$. The $y$-axis is the $r$-axis and goes from 0 (in $\bar{\beta}$)
%to some finite number $\sigma(0)>0$. For any $\beta$ between 0 and
%$\bar{\beta}$ there is a corresponding $\sigma(\beta)$. As this value needs to
%agree with the property of $\phi_{\beta}(r)$--$\phi_{\beta}(r)<0$ for
%$r<\sigma(\beta)$ and $\phi_{\beta}(r)>0$ for $r>\sigma{\beta}$-- for all
%$\beta$ then $\sigma$ is uniquely defined!

\revgroup 
In $\phib(r)$, factor out a term of $V(r)u(r)^p>0$ and gather the other terms
into $\xi(r)$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
\phi_{\beta}(r)&=\left[\beta(p-1)-2\right]V(r)u(r)^p-rV'(r)u(r)^p+
2\lambda u(r) \\
&=V(r)u(r)^p\left[\beta(p-1)-2-\frac{rV'(r)u(r)^p}{V(r)u(r)^p}+
\frac{2\lambda u(r)}{V(r)u(r)^p}\right]\\
&=V(r)u(r)^p\left[\beta(p-1)-2-r\frac{V'(r)}{V(r)}+
\frac{2\lambda}{V(r)u(r)^{p-1}}\right]\\
&= V(r)u(r)^p\left[\beta(p-1)-2-\xi(r)\right]\\ 
\text{where }\xi(r)&=r\frac{V'(r)}{V(r)}-\frac{2\lambda}{V(r)u(r)^{p-1}}.  
\end{align*}
\endgroup

We note that by \eqref{}
\[
    \phib(r)>0 \iff \beta > \Xi(r) \quad \text{and} \quad 
    \phib(r)<0 \iff \beta < \Xi(r).
\]

We claim that $\xi(r)$ is non-positive and strictly decreasing on $(,)$
{\red either interval in text, or in math}
\be \label{xiclaim}
\begin{dcases}
\xi(r) \leq 0 \quad \text{on} ~ (,)\\
\xi'(r) < 0 \quad \text{on} ~ (,)
\end{dcases}
\ee

In other words: 
$$\xi(r)\leq0\text{ and }\xi'(r)<0\text{ on }(0,\za).$$ 

By \eqref{vh4}, we have $h'(r) \leq 0$ on $(0, \infty)$. Since $u'(r, \a) < 0$
by Lemma \ref{genlem2} and $V' \leq 0$ by \eqref{vh2}, the second term in
$\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing. Hence, $\xi'(r) < 0$. 

% To see this, note how the first fraction in the expression for $\xi(r)$ is
% nonincreasing: 
% $$h(r)=r\frac{V'(r)}{V(r)}$$ 
% 
% as the numerator $V'(r)$ is negative everywhere, the denominator $V(r)$ is
% positive everywhere and of course $r>0$. By similar reasoning, the second term
% of $\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing. We know that $V(r)$ is decreasing and so is
% $u(r)$ (hence $u(r)^{p-1}$ as well). Since the numerator $\lambda>0$ is constant
% and the denominator is strictly decreasing, the fraction is strictly increasing
% such that the second term of $\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing. Thus $\xi(r)$ is
% strictly decreasing. 

Since $u(z(\alpha))=0$ for $\a \in N$ and $u(r, \a) \to 0$ as $r \to \infty$ for
$\a \in G$, we conclude that 
\be \label{xilim}
    \lim_{r\to z(\alpha)}\xi(r)=-\infty,
\ee

{\red where we remember the notation $\za = \infty$ to unite the cases for $\a
\in G$ and $\a \in N$.}

Even if $V(r)$ is non-zero, then still, the fraction blows up by the behaviour
of $u(r)$ near $\za$.

Next, we can show that $\Xi(0)>0$ and $\Xi(r)$ is continuous and strictly
decreasing. First $\Xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing because $\xi(r)$ is strictly
decreasing and $\Xi(r)$ is a monotonous transformation \# ?. By similar
argument, $\Xi(r)$ is continous. $\Xi(r)=\left[2+\xi(r)\right]/(p-1)$ satisfies
$\Xi(0)>0$. To see that $\Xi(0)>0$, evaluate $\xi(r)$ in $r=0$ and compare:
$$\Xi(0)>0\iff\xi(0)>-2.$$

Evaluating $\xi(0)$ for infinite $V(0)$ relies on \#. When $V(0)=\infty$ then
the second term in $\xi(0)$ is zero, since $u(0,\a)^{p-1}=\a^{p-1}$. Then
$\xi(0)=h_0$. And by \# $h_0+k\geq0$ so $h_0>-k$. Since $k\in(0,2)$ the lowest
bound for $h_0$ is $-k>-2$. Alternatively, when $V(0)$ is finite, then $h_0=0$
by \#. Then $$\xi(0)=-\frac{2\lambda}{\a^{p-1}V(0)}.$$ Now we can solve for $\a$
to find the values of $\a$ for which $\xi(0)>-2$.  
\begin{align*}
-\frac{2\lambda}{\a^{p-1}V(0)}>-2\\ \frac{\lambda}{\a^{p-1}V(0)}<1\\
\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}<\a^{p-1}\\ 
\a > \left[\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}\right]^{\frac{1}{p-1}} 
\end{align*} 

which is confirmed by the assumption that $\a\in G\cup N$ \# is it?.

Trailing back our steps, we see that $\xi(0)>-2$ which implies $\Xi(0)>0$. For
any $\beta\in(0,\bar{\beta})$ we have
$$\beta<\Xi(r)\iff\beta(p-1)-2-\xi(r)<0\quad\text{ and vice versa.}$$ 

\# conclude that this verifies the existence of the unique function
$\sigma(\beta)$ with the aforementioned properties. that is $\sigma(\beta)$ is
continuous and decreasing and $\sigma(0)>0$ and $\sigma(\bar{\beta})=0$ as well
as $\sigma(\beta)$ determing the sign of $\phi_\beta(r)$ for all $\beta>0$.

% Now that we have confirmed $\Xi(0)>0$ and $\Xi(r)$ strictly decreasing... \#
% Let $\Xi(0)=\bar\beta$, \#, for all $\beta\in[0,\bar\beta]$. Note $\Xi(r)$ is

% properties (a) and (b).\# Also, note $\Xi(0)>0\iff\xi(0)>-2$. \# \# Show that

\section{More advanced properties of solutions}
We fix $\nu = \nu_{\beta_0}$ and $\rho_0 = \rho \left( \beta_0 \right)$. We will
apply the Sturm comparison theorem to equations \eqref{} and \eqref{} in the 
following lemma.

\begin{lemma}\label{genlem6}
For $\alpha\in G\cup N$, $~w(r,\a)$ has a unique zero $r_0\in(0,z(\alpha)).$
Furthermore, \hfill\\ $w(z(\alpha))<0$ for $\a\in N$ and if $\a\in G$, we have
\[
\underset{r\to\infty}{\lim}w(r)=-\infty.
\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
With simplifications from before, we have
\be \label{nulivp}
\nu'' + \frac{1}{r} \nu' + \left[ p V(r) u(r)^{p-1} - \lambda \right] \nu < 0
\quad \text{and} ~ \nu < 0 \quad \text{on} ~ (0, \rho_0)
\ee

whereas
\be \label{nugivp}
\nu'' + \frac{1}{r} \nu' + \left[ p V(r) u(r)^{p-1} - \lambda \right] \nu < 0
\quad \text{and} ~ \nu < 0 \quad \text{on} ~ (\rho_0, \za).
\ee

Moreover, $\nu(0) = \beta_0 \a > 0$ and $\underset{r\to 0}{\lim} r\nu'(r) = 0$.
Furthermore, if $\a\in N$, then 
\[ \nu(\za) = \za u'(\za) < 0 \]
by Lemma \ref{genlem2} and so $\nu$ has a unique zero $\rho_0$ in $[0,\za]$.

Let $\tau \in (0,\za)$ be the first zero of $w$, which exists by Lemma
\ref{genlem3}. We remember that $w$ satisfies
\be \label{wivp}
w'' + \frac{1}{r} w' + \left[ p V(r) u^{p-1} - \lambda w \right] w = 0
\quad \text{for} ~ r \in (0, \za),
\ee

with initial data $w(0) = 1$ and $\underset{r\to 0}{\lim} rw'(r) = 0$. Because
of this, by \# sturm, we know that $\nu$ oscillates faster than $w$.

Then $\rho_0 \in (0,\tau)$ and thus
\be \label{nutivp}
\nu'' + \frac{1}{r} \nu' + \left[ p V(r) u(r)^{p-1} - \lambda \right] \nu < 0
\quad \text{and} ~ \nu < 0 \quad \text{on} ~ (\tau, \za).
\ee

Since $w(\tau)=0$ and $\nu$ has no zero larger than $\rho_0$, by Sturm we have
that $w$ has no further zero in $(\tau, \za)$ and we can set $r_0 = \tau$. If
$\za < \infty$, then $w$ has no zero on $(\tau, \za]$ and we have $w(\za) < 0$.

However, if $\za = \infty$, we can apply Lemma 6 of \cite[p.~249]{kwong}. The
disconjugacy interal $(d, \infty)$ is such that 
\[ d < \rho_0 < r_0. \]

\begin{emph}
    The disconjugacy interval of a differential equation is the largest
    left-neighbourhood $(c, b)$ of the {\red right most} $b$ on which there
    exists a solution to the differential equation without zeroes. From Sturmian
    theory, no non-trivial solution can have more than one zero in $(c, b)$. On
    the other hand, unless $c = a$, with $a$ the {\red left most}, any solution
    of the differential equation with a zero before $c$ must have another zero
    in $(c, b)$. 

    Consider the same setting: equations \eqref{sturm:uivp} and
    \eqref{sturm:vivp} satisfying the comparison condition
    \eqref{sturm:compare}. In addition, we assume that $U \neq V$ in \emph{any}
    neighborhood of $b$. If there exists a solution $V$ of \eqref{sturm:vivp}
    with a largest zero at the point $\rho$, then the disconjugacy interval of
    \eqref{sturm:uivp} is a strict superset of $(\rho, b)$. 

    One way to interpret the above is to remember that $V$ oscillates faster
    than $U$ and note that any solution $U$ with a zero in $(\rho, b)$ 
\end{emph}

Indeed, if we had $\rho_0 \leq d$, we could find a solution $\tilde{w}$ linearly
independent of $w$ such that $\tilde{w}(\tilde{r}) = 0$ for some $\tilde{r} > d
\geq \rho_0$. But then $w + \tilde{w}$ is a solution of \# $w$ ivp with two
zeroes in $(\rho_0, \infty)$ and thus, $\nu$ should have another zero in {\red that
interval}. By this contradiction, we have $w(r_0) = 0$ with $r_0 \in (d,
\infty)$ and Lemma 6 of \cite[p.~249]{kwong} implies that
\[ \underset{r\to\infty}{\lim} w(r) = -\infty. \]


% Interpreting the statements in this lemma, we will see that $w(r,\a)$ has a
% \textbf{unique} zero $r_0$ to the left of $z(\alpha)$, the zero of the solution
% $u(r,\a)$. When concerned with a ground state solution, $u(r,\a)$ has no finite
% zero, signified by $z(\alpha)=\infty$. Then still $w(r,\a)$ has a finite zero
% $r_0\in(0,\infty)$ and $w(r,\a)<0$ for $r>r_0$ and after $r_0$ the function
% $w(r,\a)$ tends to negative infinity for $r\to\infty$, that is
% $\underset{r\to\infty}{\lim}w(r)=-\infty$.
% 
% Remember that the differential equation in $\nu_{\beta}(r)$ changes sign when
% equal to a value of $\phi_\beta(r)$. In turn, this function $\phi_\beta(r)$
% changes sign in the $r$-value $\sigma(\beta)$. By fixing $\beta=\beta_0$ such
% that $\rho(\beta)$ and $\sigma(\beta)$ intersect in $\beta_0$
% ($\sigma(\beta_0)=\rho(\beta_0)=\rho_0$) we have achieved a crucial step.
% Certain zeroes related to $\nub(r)$ now coincide because of this choice
% $\beta=\beta_0$. Remember that $\phi_{\beta_0}$ changes sign in $r=\rho_0$.
% Which implies that the differential equation in $\nu_{\beta_0}(r)$ changes sign
% in $\rho_0$. But by the definition of $\nub(r)$, we can see that the zero of
% $\nub(r)$ now coincides with the sign change of the differential equation:
% $\rho_0$ is the value in which $\nu_{\beta_0}(r)$ changes sign, since
% $$\nu_{\beta_0}(\rho_0)=-u(\rho_0)\left\{\theta(\rho_0)-\beta_0\right\}=0.$$ The
% last equality follows from $\theta(\rho_0)=\beta_0\iff\rho(\beta_0)=\rho_0$ such
% that $\theta(\rho_0)-\beta_0=0$.
% %
% \begin{gather*}
% \nu''+\frac{1}{r}\nu'+\left[pV(r)u(r)^{p-1}-\lambda\right]\nu<0\quad\text{ on
% }\quad(0,\rho_0)\quad\text{ where }\quad\nu>0\\
% \nu''+\frac{1}{r}\nu'+\left[pV(r)u(r)^{p-1}-\lambda\right]\nu>0\quad\text{ on
% }\quad(\rho_0,\infty)\quad\text{ where }\quad\nu<0 \end{gather*}
% %
% By \# we know that the solution $\nu(r)$ changes sign in
% $\rho_0\in[0,z(\alpha)]$. $$\nu(z(\alpha))z(\alpha)u'(z(\alpha))<0,$$ the
% solution $\nu(r)$ changes sign once. \# expand Since by \# $w(r,\a)$ has at
% least one zero for $\a\in G\cup N$, let $\tau$ be the first zero of $w(r)$. \#
% setup up the Sturm comparison functions for $w$ and $\nu$ and explain Since
% $\nu(r)$ oscillates faster than $w(r,\a)$, there will be a zero to the left of
% $\tau$. That is, $\nu(\rho_0)=0$ with $\rho_0\in(0,\tau)$. 
% 
% Also by Sturm comparison, $w$ can have no further zero and $\tau$ is the unique
% zero of $w$. Suppose that $w$ has a zero with $r_1>r_0$. Then $\nu$ must have a
% zero between $r_0$ and $r_1$. Yet, $\nu$ has a unique zero $\rho_)$, a
% contradiction.
% 
% `'By previous lemmata' the sign of $\nu$ changes in $\rho_0$.  Refer to lemma

% have a zero and some that don't', the function $w(r)$ must have a zero.  Even
% more, the zero of $w$ will be to the left of the zero of $u(r)$.
% CIRKELREDENERING?  Then $u(r)$ does not have a zero, the limit of $w(r)$ for $r$
% to infinity is negative infinity.  To see this, note that for increasing
% $\alpha$, one will obtain a solution that \emph{has} a zero.  Hence in that

\begin{lemma}\label{genlem7}
Let $\a \in G$. There exists $\epsilon > 0$ such that $(\a, \a + \epsilon)
\subset N$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We remember that $w(r)$ has a unique zero $r_0$. 
% and $w(r) = w(r, \a) \coloneqq \frac{\partial}{\partial \a} u(r, \a)$. 
Furthermore, by Lemma 6 of \cite[p.~249]{kwong} we know $r_0 \in (d,
\infty)$, where $(d, \infty)$ is the disconjugacy interval of \eqref{genwivp}.
We refer to \# for the definition of disconjugacy interval. We can choose
$r_1$ and $r_2$ around $r_0$
\[ d < r_1 < r_0 < r_2, \]

such that by \eqref{wdef}, there exists $\epsilon > 0$ 
such that for all $\tilde{\a} \in (\a, \a + \epsilon)$, we have
\[
\tilde{u}(r_1) > u(r_1)\quad\text{ and }\quad \tilde{u}(r_2) < u(r_2).
\]

Hence the graphs of $u$ and $\tilde{u}$ intersect in some $r_3 \in (r_1, r_2)$,
where $r_3$ depends on the choice of $\tilde{\a}$. Next, we will show that there
exists $\tilde{r} \in (r_3, \infty)$ such that $\tilde{u}(\tilde{r}) = 0$.
{\red LATER Hence, $\tilde{\a} \in N$.}

By contradiction, we suppose that $\tilde{u}(r) > 0$ for all $r > r_3$.

We will show that $\tilde{u}(r) < u(r)$ for all $r > r_3$.

By contradiction, we suppose that $\tilde{u}(r_4) = u(r_4)$ for some $r_4 > r_3$
and $u - \tilde{u} > 0$ on $(r_3, r_4)$.

The function $z \coloneqq u - \tilde{u}$ satisfies
\be \label{zivp}
z'' + \frac{1}{r} z' + \left[ V(r) \frac{u^p - \tilde{u}^p}{u - \tilde{u}}

\ee

% We shall compare this differential equation with \# w ivp.

Since $z(r_3) = z(r_4) = 0$ by assumption and
\be \label{zcomp} 
\frac{u^p - \tilde{u}^p}{u - \tilde{u}} < pu^{p-1} 
\ee

on $(r_3, r_4)$, we can apply Sturm's theorem \# ref. {\red Who oscillates

Hence $z(r) > 0$ for all $r > r_3$. Then $w$ oscillates faster than $z$ ???

Hence $z(r) \equiv u(r) - \tilde{u}(r) \to \infty$ as $r \to \infty$. This is
impossible, since $0 < \tilde{u}(r) < u(r)$ on $(r_3, \infty)$ and $u(r) \to 0$
as $r \to \infty$. Therefore, $\tilde{u}(r)$ must vanish at some point
$\tilde{r} \in (r_3, \infty)$ and the proof is complete.

\section{Initial value problem and solution sets}
We are interested in the uniqueness of ground state solutions to the soliton
equation \eqref{}. The existence of solutions was treated in chapter \ref{ch2}.
We study the proof by Genoud in \cite{gen11}. Several lemmata will lead to the
conclusion that the set of initial conditions has the following structure
\[ P=(0,\a_0)\quad G=\left\{\a_0\right\}\quad N=(\a_0,\infty) \]

Broadly speaking, we wish to study zeroes of the solution $u(r,\a)$ as a
function of the initial condition $\a$. {\red We define}
\[ \za. \]

By studying the related differential equations in $w(r)$ and $\nu(r)$, and
applying the Sturm comparison theorem, we will show that $z(\a)$ is
monotone decreasing. Furthermore {\red $G$ is open and contiguous}.

Through the chapter, we assume $n=2$. There are more assumptions on $f(u)$
\[ f(u) = \lambda V(r)u(r) - u(r)^p \]

{\red Compare with $f(u)=u-u^3$}.

\section{Lemma 1}
By \# solution set $P$ is non-empty. That is, solutions to \# that are positive
for all $r$ exist. What initial conditions yield such solutions? By studying
the sign of a Lyapunov function $E(r)$ for our problem, we can show that
$(0,\a^*)\subset P$ for certain $\a^*$. \# Expand on Lyapunov. By the initial
value problem, we can show that $E(r)$ is non-increasing for all $r$. This will
separate the initial conditions into $\a\in P$ and $\a\in G\cup N$. After this
lemma, we will study the implications of the latter case.

The Lyapunov (or energy) function can yield information about the solutions.
Let the Lyapunov function be defined as
$$E(r)\coloneqq\frac{1}{2}u'(r)^2-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(r)u(r)^{p+1}$$
on $(0,\za)$. Evaluating the Lyapunov function in $r=0$, we see that the sign
in $r=0$ depends on the initial condition. Solving for $\a$ in
$$E(0)=0\iff-\frac{\lambda}{2}\alpha^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(0)\alpha^{p+1}=0$$ yields
the critical initial condition
$\a^*=\left[\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(0)} \right]^{1/(p-1)}$. 

Additionally, the Lyapunov function $E(r)$ is non-increasing everywhere.
Calculating the derivative as
$$E'(r)=-\frac{u'(r)^2}{r}+\frac{1}{p+1}V'(r)u(r)^{p+1}$$ and using the initial
value problem, we obtain $E'(r)\leq0$ for $r>0$. Now, initial conditions below
$\a^*$ are in solution set $P$. This relies on \#...  

Let $\a\in G\cup N$. The Lyapunov function $E(r)$ evaluated in $r=0$ will now
be greater than or equal to zero. Consider the case for $\a\in N$ and $\a\in G$
seperately. Evaluate the Lyapunov function $E(r)$ in $r=\za$. Clearly,
$E(\za)>0$ \#... Now, evaluate the Lyapunov function $E(r)$ in the limit for
$r\to\infty$. Denote this as \# lim r etc.. $E(\infty)$. Clearly $E(\infty)=0$.
\# weave in ... To see this, note that both $u(r)$ and $u'(r)$ vanish for
$r\to\infty$ and calculate the limit $\underset{r\to\infty}{\lim}E(r)=0$. But
$E(r)$ is non-increasing, so $E(0)\geq0$.

In conclusion, the Lyapunov function $E(r)$ defined for $r>0$ splits the
initial conditions around $\a^*$. That is, $\a_P<\a^*<\a_{G\cup N}$. By the
derivative $E'(r)$ and the initial value problem \#, we know that $E(r)$ is
non-increasing for $r>0$. Lastly, for $\a\in P$ we have $E(0)<0$. And for
$\a\in G$ we have $E(0)\geq0$ and for $\a\in N$, we have $E(0)>0$.

Note: \# Similarly, for $\a\in N$, the solution $u(r)$ vanishes in some $\za$.
Evaluating $\underset{r\to\za}{\lim}E(r)=\frac{1}{2}u'(\za)^2$ and noting that
by definition of $N$ we have $u'(\za)\neq0$, we find that $E(0)\geq0$.

Note: \# This begs the question, is $E(0)$ non-negative for all initial
conditions? Solving $E(0)<0$ yields initial conditions that must belong to $P$,
not to contradict the results that for $\a\in G\cup N$ we have $E(0)\geq0$.

This lemma states an interval of initial conditions $0<\a<\ldots$ for which the
corresponding  solution belongs to solution set $P$. The proof of the lemma
involves a Lyapunov (or energy) functions $E(r)$ and its derivative $E'(r)$,
which are related to \# the IVP. Enough is known about the terms in the
derivative $E'(r)$ to conclude that the function $E(r)$ is non-increasing for
all $r$. For initial conditions in solution sets $G$ or $N$, the defining
properties of $u(r)$ and $u'(r)$ yield that $E(0)\geq0$. Furthermore, the
function $E(r)$ is non-increasing, so that for any $r\geq0$ we have
$E(r)\geq0$. This splits the initial conditions in two sets, as we will see,
for $\a\in G\cup N$ we have $E(0)\geq0$. Suppose that there are initial
conditions which have $E(0)<0$, the the assumption that these belong to $G$ or
$N$ leads to a contradiction since that would imply $E(0)\geq0$. Then these
initial conditions must belong to solution set $P$. The actual upper bound in
$0<\a<\ldots$ arises from solving $E(0)<0$.

\begin{proof}
Define the Lyapunov (or energy) function $E(r)$ on $(0,\za)$ as:
$$E(r)\coloneqq\frac{1}{2}u'(r)^2
-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(r)u(r)^{p+1},$$
We directly calculate the derivative $E'(r)$ and use the \cref{ivp} to simplify. 
\begin{align*}
&\left[u''(r)-\lambda u(r)+V(r)u(r)^p\right]=
-\frac{1}{r}u'(r)\quad\text{from the IVP, and}\\
E'(r)&=u''(r)u'(r)-\lambda u(r)u'(r)+V(r)u(r)^pu'(r)+\frac{1}{p+1}V'(r)u(r)^{p+1}\\
&=\left[u''(r)-\lambda u(r)+V(r)u(r)^p\right]u'(r)+\frac{1}{p+1}V'(r)u(r)^{p+1}\\
&=-\frac{u'(r)^2}{r}+\frac{1}{p+1}V'(r)u(r)^{p+1}\leq0\text{ for }r>0.\\
\end{align*}
We know that $E'(r)$ is non-positive for $r>0$, because:
\begin{easylist}[itemize]
@ $V'(r)\leq0$, by hypothesis H2;
@ $u(r)^{p+1}\geq0$ because $u(r)$ is positive on $(0,z(\a))$ for any initial condition $\a$;
@ $r\geq0$;
@ $u'(r)^2\geq0$.
\end{easylist}
Then $E(r)$ is non-increasing $(0,z(\a))$.

Suppose $\a\in G$. Then $u(r)\to0$ and $u'(r)\to0$ as $r\to\infty$. Then $E(r)=0$ for $r\to\infty$. In conclusion $E(0)\geq0$.
Alternatively, suppose $\a\in N$, then $u(\za)=0$. Now evaluate:
\begin{empheq}{align*}
\underset{r\to z(\alpha)}{\lim}E(r)&=\underset{r\to z(\alpha)}{\lim}\bigg[\frac{1}{2}u'(r)^2-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(r)u(r)^{p+1}\bigg] \\
&=u'(z(\alpha))^2\geq0.
\end{empheq}
As $E(r)$ is non-increasing, $E(0)\geq0$.
Result: $E(0)\geq0$ and $E(r)$ well-defined on $[0,z(\a)]$ for $\a\in G\cup N$.

\emph{Proof step} We solve $E(0)=0$ to find an upper bound $0<\a<\ldots$ such that $E(0)<0)$:
\begin{align*}
E(0)=~&\frac{1}{2}u'(0)^2-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(0)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(0)u(0)^{p+1}<0\\
&\iff -\frac{\lambda}{2}\alpha^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(0)\alpha^{p+1}<0\\
&\iff\alpha^{p-1}<\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}\\
&\iff\alpha<\left[\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(0)} \right]^{1/(p-1)}
%
% \iff\alpha^{p-1}<\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}\iff
%\frac{1}{p+1}V(0)\alpha^{p-1}<\frac{\lambda}{2}\\
% -\frac{\lambda}{2}\alpha^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(0)\alpha^{p+1}<0\\
% \implies E(0)=\frac{1}{2}u'(0)^2-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(0)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(0)u(0)^{p+1}<0.
\end{align*}
In conclusion, we have $\a\in P$ whenever $0<\a<\left[\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}\right]^{1/(p-1)}$.
\end{proof}




\section{Lemma 2}
To separate the solutions corrsponding to initial conditions belonging to $G$ or $N$, we need to study the zero (or zeroes) of $u(r,\a)$. This can not be done directly. However, it can be shown directly that all solutions with initial condition in $G$ or $N$ are decreasing everywhere. That is, $u'(r,\a)<0$ where the derivative is with respect to $r$. 

%Goal: This lemma aims to show that the solution decreases everywhere on $(0,\za)$ for $\a\in G\cup N$ and for $\a\in N$ even $u'(\za)<0$. This is an important step in showing that $w(r)$ has a unique zero on $(0,\za)$, which is the central step to showing that $\a\in G$ is unique.

This will be done again by studying the Lyapunov function $E(r)$. Note that the assumption "$V(0)$ is finite" is no longer present. From the previous lemma and the IVP it follows, in either case, that $u''(0)<0$ and $u'(0^+)<0$. If $V(0)$ is finite, then \#. If $V(0)$ is infinite, then \#. 

Suppose now that the derivative of the solution with respect to $r$ vanishes in $r_0$, that is $u'(r_0)=0$ for some $r_0$. Then the \cref{ivp} yields an equation in $u(r_0)$ and $u''(r_0)$. By concavity of the graph of the solution $u(r)$, we have $u''(r_0)>0$. Expand concavity argument \#. Then using the Lyapunov function evaluated in $r_0$, we find $E(r_0)<0$ which contradicts the assumption that $\a\in G\cup N$. Give evaluation \#. Hence, $u'(r)<0$ everywhere.

In conclusion, the solution sets $G$ and $N$ have $u'(r)<0$ everywhere on $(0,\za)$ for $\a\in G$ and $(0,\za]$ for $\a\in N$. The lemma shows $u(r)$ strictly decreasing on $(0,\za)$ for $\a\in G\cup N$. The rest of the proof uses this to conclude that $w(r)$ has a unique zero on $(0,\za)$. Finally, analysis of solution sets $N$ and $G$ leads to the uniqueness result. Write $\za=\infty$ when $\a\in G$, since $u(r,\a)\to0$ as $r\to\infty$. Let $\a\in G\cup N$. By lemma \# 4 (1?), $E(r)\geq0$ on $[0,\za]$ and non-increasing.

Question: what is an example of infinite $V(0)$ and is it relevant for my thesis? Problem with $E(0)=...V(0)$, might blow up.

\begin{proof}
By \cref{ivp}, we have $E(r)\geq0$ in the limit that $r$ goes to $\za$. Since $E(r)$ is non-increasing, $E(r)\geq0$ for all $r\in(0,\za]$. Note that $E(0)$ is no longer well-defined as the assumption that $V(0)$ is finite is no longer present.

\# Lemma 1 and the \# \cref{ivp} yield $u''(0)<0$ and $u'(r)<0$ for $r>0$ and small. No explicit argument is presented in \# Genoud. The argument that $u''(0)<0$ is not expanded upon here. To see why $u''(0)<0$ implies $u'(r)<0$ for $r>0$ and small, reason by concavity. Since $u''(0)<0$, the graph is concave down. This implies that $u'(r)<u'(0)$ for $r>0$ and small. 

This result $u'(r)<0$ for $r$ small, can be extended for larger $r$, even up to (or including) $\za$. Suppose by contradiction that $r_0=\inf(r<\za,u'(r)=0)$ exists. That is, the derivative $u'(r)$ vanishes in $r_0$ or $u'(r_0)=0$. This implies that $u''(r)$ was positive on $(r,r_0)$ for some $r>0$. Both $u''(r_0)=0$ and $u''(r_0)>0$ lead to a contradiction. The combination of $u''(r_0)$ and $u'(r_0)=0$ would imply $u\equiv u(r_0)$, a contradiction. To see how $u''(r_0)>0$ leads to a contradiction, invoke the \# \cref{ivp}: 
\begin{align*}
&u''(r_0)=\lambda u(r_0)-V(r_0)u(r_0)^p>0\\
\implies &u(r_0)<\left[\frac{\lambda}{V(r_0)}\right]^{1/(p-1)}<\left[\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(r_0)}\right]^{1/(p-1)}\\
\text{\# suppose that }u(r_0)\neq0\\
\iff &u(r_0)<\left[\frac{\lambda}{V(r_0)}\right]<\left[\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(r_0)}\right]^{1/(p-1)}\\
\text{since }\frac{p+1}{2}>1\\
\iff &u(r_0)^{p-1}<\left(\frac{p+1}{2}\right)\frac{\lambda}{V(r_0)}\\
\iff &\frac{1}{p+1}V(r_0)u(r_0)^{p+1}<\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r_0)^2\\
\iff &-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r_0)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(r_0)u(r_0)^{p+1}<0
% \implies E(r_0)=-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r_0)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(r_0)u(r_0)^{p+1}<0,
\end{align*}
Then evaluating the Lyapunov function $E(r)$ with the assumption $u'(r_0)=0$, this yields $E(r_0)<0$:
$$ E(r_0)=-\frac{\lambda}{2}u(r_0)^2+\frac{1}{p+1}V(r_0)u(r_0)^{p+1}<0 $$
But $E(r_0)<0$ contradicts $E(r)\geq0$, so $u'<0$ on $(0,z(\alpha))$.

To see that $u'(\za)<0$ when $\a\in N$, suppose by contradiction that $u'(\za)=0$ and remember that by definition $u(\za)=0$. Then $u\equiv0$, because by the \# \cref{ivp} we have that $u''(\za)=\lambda u(\za)-V(\za)u(\za)^p=0$. \# Contradiction: the solution $u=\equiv$ is not in $N$.

\underline{Conclusion:} $u'(z(\alpha))<0$ for $r\in(0,\za)$ if $\a\in G$ and $r\in(0,\za]$ if $\a\in N$.
\end{proof}



\section{Lemma 3}
Even though solutions in sets $G$ and $N$ have been shown to be decreasing everywhere, there is no information about the zeroes. In this lemma, through the Lagrange identity, information about zeroes of the derivative of the solution with respect to the initial condition can be achieved. Define $$w(r,\a) = \frac{\partial}{\partial\a} u(r,\a)$$ and evaluate the Lagrange identity for \# and \# in $0$ and $\za$. The conclusion will be that $w(r,\a)$ changes sign at least once on $(0,\za)$. Later, this result will be improved, the zero of $w(r,\a)$ is unique and this ultimately leads to the uniqueness of the ground state solution. But for now, enough work to do!

\begin{proof}
The Lagrange identity for \cref{ivp} and \cref{wvp} will yield information about the zeroes of $w(r)$. The cases $\a\in N$ and $\a\in G$ will be considered seperately. First, suppose $\a\in N$. The differential equations for $u$ and $w$ can be written as:
\begin{gather*}
  (ru'(r))'+r\left[-\lambda u(r)+V(r)u(r)^p\right]=0\\
  (rw'(r))'+r\left[-\lambda w(r)+pV(r)u(r)^{p-1}w(r)\right]=0.
\end{gather*}
Multiply these equations by $w(r)$ and $u(r)$ respectively and subtract to obtain:
\begin{gather*}
	z(\alpha)w(r)(ru'(r))'-u(r)(rw'(r))'=r\left\{pV(r)u(r)^pw(r)-V(r)u(r)^pw(r)\right\},
\end{gather*}
Now integrate from $0$ to $\za$ to obtain: 
\begin{gather*}
  \int_0^{z(\alpha)}w(r)(ru'(r))'-u(r)(rw'(r))'dr=
  \int_0^{z(\alpha)}r\left\{pV(r)u(r)^pw(r)-V(r)u(r)^pw(r)\right\}dr.
\end{gather*}
Now perform partial integration for the left hand side and remember $u(z(\a))=0$:
% \begin{align*}
%   rw(r)u'(r)\at_0^{z(\alpha)}-ru(r)w'(r)\at_0^{z(\alpha)}&-
%   \int_0^{z(\alpha)}\underbrace{\{ru'(r)w'(r)-ru'(r)w'(r)\}}_0dr\\
%   &=(p-1)\int_0^{z(\alpha)}rV(r)u(r)^pw(r)dr\\
%   z(\alpha)w(z(\alpha))u'(z(\alpha))&=(p-1)\int_0^{z(\alpha)}rV(r)u(r)^pw(r)dr.
% \end{align*}

For $\a\in N$, note $r>0,~V>0,~u^p>0$ are finite almost everywhere. Suppose $w>0$ on $(0,z(\alpha))$. Then the left hand side and right hand side disagree, $$z(\alpha)u'(z(\alpha))w(z(\alpha))<0\text{, while }(p-1)\int_0^{z(\alpha)}rV(r)u(r)^pw(r)dr>0.$$ A similar argument holds for $w<0$. \underline{Conclusion:} $w$ changes sign at least once on $(0,z(\a))$.

For $\alpha\in G$, suppose by contradiction that $w>0$ on $(0,\infty)$.
Integrate \# \cref{ivp} from $0$ to $r$ and rewrite the left hand side using the quotient rule:
\begin{align*}
ru'(r)w(r)-rw'(r)u(r)
=r\frac{u'(r)w(r)-w'(r)u(r)}{w(r)^2}
&=rw(r)^2\left(\frac{u(r)}{w(r)}\right)'\\
rw(r)^2\left(\frac{u(r)}{w(r)}\right)'
&=(p-1)\int_0^{z(\alpha)}rV(r)u(r)^pw(r)dr>0.
\end{align*}
By similar reasoning as before, the right hand side is still positive. Hence, the left hand side is also positive. This implies that the term quotient of $u$ and $w$ is increasing.
\underline{Result:} $\left(\frac{u}{w}\right)'$ is positive, so $\frac{u}{w}(r)$ is increasing.

Before, the left hand side was contradictory by simple reasons. Unfortunately, this is not the case now. In summary,  by Lemma C.1 of \cite{fthes}, for $\a>0$ the quantity $\frac{u(r)}{w(r)}$ vanishes in the limit that $r\to\infty$. This contradicts the earlier assumption that $\frac{u}{w}(r)$ is increasing.
\# Is it really this simple? What about Theoreme 1.4.9. And the subtlety in having asymptotic behaviour of both w and u?

In conclusion, for $\a\in G$ the assumption that $w>0$ is again contradictory. \# and for $w<0$... Hence, $w$ changes sign at least once on $(0,z(\a))$ for $\a\in G\cup N$.
\end{proof}

\section{Lemmata A}
The previous result can be improved upon. In fact, $w$ can be shown to have a unique zero. With the Sturm comparison theorem, this can be used to construct more lemmata and finally to show that $G$ contains at most one element, i.e. the ground state solution is unique.

In the lemmata following, many related properties are used. This section is dedicated to properly introducing those functions and their properties. A \emph{shopping list}: we will introduce $\theta(r)$, $\rho(\beta)$, $\nu_\beta(r)$, $\phi_\beta(r)$. Then lemma 4 introduces $\sigma(\beta)$, $\xi(r)$, $\Xi(r)$. All of these functions are related to the original initial value problem in $u(r)$, to the problem in $w(r)$ or to the problem $\nu(r)$ which is a transformation of the problem in $u(r)$ including the $\beta$ parameter. This $\beta$ will be fixed in lemma 5 to construct a zero $\rho_0$ for the $\nu(r)$ problem. In lemma 6 the problem in $\nu(r)$ and $w(r)$ are Sturm compared to show that the zero of $w(r)$ is unique. The uniqueness of the zero of $w(r)$ will translate to the monotone decreasing $\za$ which translates to the structure of $I=P\cup G\cup N$ and the required uniqueness result.

First, define the function $\theta(r)$ as: 
$$\theta(r)\coloneqq-r\frac{u'(r)}{u(r)}\text{, for }r\in[0,z(\alpha).$$ 
The limit for $r$ to zero is calculated as: 
$$\theta(0)=\underset{r\downarrow0}{\lim}\theta(r)=\underset{r\downarrow0}{\lim}\left(-r\frac{u'(r)}{u(r)}\right)=\underset{r\downarrow0}{\lim}\frac{-ru'(r)}{\a}=0.$$ 
Combined with the fact that $\theta(r)$ is increasing ($\theta'(r)>0$), we have $\theta(r)>0$ on $(0,\za)$, \# argument that $\theta$ is increasing. 
Lastly, the function is unbounded as $\underset{r\to\za}{\lim}\theta(r)=\infty$. To see this, let $\a\in N$ then $\za$ is the first zero of the solution $u(r,\a)$. Also, by \# the derivative is negative everywhere. Hence by definition of $\theta(r)$ the limit for $r\to\za$ is infinity. A similar argument holds for $\a\in G$.

The function $\theta(r)$ is continuous and increasing, so there exists an inverse function. Define $\rho\coloneqq\theta^{-1}$. Then $$\rb=r\iff\theta(r)=\beta.$$ 

But what are the properties of this inverse function $\rb$? First, we must have $\rho(0)=0$ and $\underset{\beta\to\infty}{\lim}\rb=\za$. Note how $\rb$ too is continuous and increasing, but with respect to $\beta$. Note that $\rb$ is positive, that is, $\rb>0$ on $(0,\infty)$. \# image of $\theta(r)$ and inverse $\rb$. 

Now define a transformed version of the \# $$\nu_{\beta}(r)\coloneqq ru'(r)+\beta u(r)=-u(r){\theta(r)-\beta}.$$ 
While the solution $u(r,\a)$ was positive everywhere on $(0,\za)$ this is not necessarily true for $\nub$. 
Note that $u(r)>0$ so $\nub>0$ if $\tr-\beta<0$. 
That is, $0>\tr-\beta\iff\beta>\tr\iff\rb>r$. 
Let $\beta>0,$ then $\nu_{\beta}(r)>0$ if $r<\rho(\beta)$ and $\nu_{\beta}(r)<0$ if $r>\rho(\beta)$. 
Similarly, $\nub<0$ if $\beta<\tr\iff\rb<r$. 
All of these properties can also be illustrated \#. 

To see that $\nu_{\beta}(r)$ satisfies the differential equation... 
$$\nu_{\beta}''(r)+\frac{1}{r}\nu_{\beta}(r)'-\lambda\nu_{\beta}+pV(r)u(r)^{p-1}\nu_{\beta}=\phi_{\beta}(r)$$
where the function $\phib(r)$ on the right hand side is defined as $$\phi_{\beta}(r)\coloneqq\left[\beta(p-1)-2\right]V(r)u(r)^p-rV'(r)u(r)^p+2\lambda u(r).$$
\# derivation must be somewhere

In lemma 4 the above w \# argument will be used to show that the sign of $\phib(r)$ is related to a continuous decreasing function $\sib(r)$ and this function intersects $\rb$ in a unique $\beta_0$ (lemma 5). The specific $\nu_{\beta_0}$ and $\rho_0=\rho(\beta_0)$ are used in lemma 6 with the Sturm comparison theorem to show that $w$ has a unique zero on $(0,\za)$.


\section{Lemma 4}
\begin{proof}
Why is this $\sigma$ unique? Maybe because inverse of uniquely defined $\rb$?
There are infinitely many functions that agree with $\sigma(0)>0$ and $\sigma(\bar{\beta})=0$. Clearly, the other property of $\sigma$ uniquely defines the function. 
Let $\beta$ be arbitrary. This makes $\phib(r)$ fixed. 
\# Argument why $\phib$ changes sign only once. 
Then $\sib$ is defined by the zero of $\phib$. 
Since $\beta$ was arbitrary, $\sib$ is defined by $\phib$ for all $\beta$ and $\sib$ is unique. 
That $\sib$ is continuous and decreasing is shown below.

%Draw the following: $x$-axis is the $\beta$-axis and goes from 0 to $\bar{\beta}$. The $y$-axis is the $r$-axis and goes from 0 (in $\bar{\beta}$) to some finite number $\sigma(0)>0$. For any $\beta$ between 0 and $\bar{\beta}$ there is a corresponding $\sigma(\beta)$. As this value needs to agree with the property of $\phi_{\beta}(r)$--$\phi_{\beta}(r)<0$ for $r<\sigma(\beta)$ and $\phi_{\beta}(r)>0$ for $r>\sigma{\beta}$-- for all $\beta$ then $\sigma$ is uniquely defined!
To analyse the function $\phib(r)$ we will write the function more conveniently. We know that $r>0$ and $V(r)>0$ and $u(r)^p>0$ and this will allow us to assert the sign of a part of the function $\phib(r)$. In $\phib(r)$, factor out a term of $V(r)u(r)^p>0$ and gather the other terms into $\xi(r)$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
\phi_{\beta}(r)&=\left[\beta(p-1)-2\right]V(r)u(r)^p-rV'(r)u(r)^p+2\lambda u(r) \\ %\\ &=V(r)u(r)^p\left[\beta(p-1)-2-\frac{rV'(r)u(r)^p}{V(r)u(r)^p}+\frac{2\lambda u(r)}{V(r)u(r)^p}\right]\\ 
&=V(r)u(r)^p\left[\beta(p-1)-2-r\frac{V'(r)}{V(r)}+\frac{2\lambda}{V(r)u(r)^{p-1}}\right]\\ 
&= V(r)u(r)^p\left[\beta(p-1)-2-\xi(r)\right]\\
\text{where }\xi(r)&=r\frac{V'(r)}{V(r)}-\frac{2\lambda}{V(r)u(r)^{p-1}}.
\end{align*}
% Now, let $\beta>0$ arbitrarily and let $r\in[0,z(\alpha))$. 

Hence the sign of $\phi(r)$ depends on $\beta$ and $\xi(r)$ by the term in brackets. Remember that $p$ is just a constant of the initial value problem resembling a dimension \#. Note that $\phib(r)>0 \iff \left[\ldots\right]>0$. This allows us to solve for $\beta$:
$$\beta(p-1)-2-\xi(r)>0\iff\beta>\frac{2+\xi(r)}{p-1}\coloneqq\Xi(r).$$
That is, $\phib(r)$ is positive whenever $\beta$ is greater than this new function $\Xi(r)$. Studying this function $\Xi(r)$ will be our next step.

Before studying the sign of and bounds on $\Xi(r)$, we can show that the function $\xi(r)$ is non-positive and strictly decreasing on the usual interval.. In other words: $$\xi(r)\leq0\text{ and }\xi'(r)<0\text{ on }(0,\za).$$ This implies that the limit approaches negative infinity: $$\lim_{r\to z(\alpha)}\xi(r)=-\infty.$$ To see this, note how the first fraction in the expression for $\xi(r)$ is nonincreasing: $$h(r)=r\frac{V'(r)}{V(r)}$$ as the numerator $V'(r)$ is negative everywhere, the denominator $V(r)$ is positive everywhere and of course $r>0$. By similar reasoning, the second term of $\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing. We know that $V(r)$ is decreasing and so is $u(r)$ (hence $u(r)^{p-1}$ as well). Since the numerator $\lambda>0$ is constant and the denominator is strictly decreasing, the fraction is strictly increasing such that the second term of $\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing. Thus $\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing. Since $u(z(\alpha))=0$, the limit is $-\infty$. Even if $V(r)$ is non-zero, then still, the fraction blows up by the behaviour of $u(r)$ near $\za$.

Next, we can show that $\Xi(0)>0$ and $\Xi(r)$ is continuous and strictly decreasing. First $\Xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing because $\xi(r)$ is strictly decreasing and $\Xi(r)$ is a monotonous transformation \# ?. By similar argument, $\Xi(r)$ is continous. $\Xi(r)=\left[2+\xi(r)\right]/(p-1)$ satisfies $\Xi(0)>0$. To see that $\Xi(0)>0$, evaluate $\xi(r)$ in $r=0$ and compare: $$\Xi(0)>0\iff\xi(0)>-2.$$

Evaluating $\xi(0)$ for infinite $V(0)$ relies on \#. When $V(0)=\infty$ then the second term in $\xi(0)$ is zero, since $u(0,\a)^{p-1}=\a^{p-1}$. Then $\xi(0)=h_0$. And by \# $h_0+k\geq0$ so $h_0>-k$. Since $k\in(0,2)$ the lowest bound for $h_0$ is $-k>-2$. Alternatively, when $V(0)$ is finite, then $h_0=0$ by \#. Then $$\xi(0)=-\frac{2\lambda}{\a^{p-1}V(0)}.$$ Now we can solve for $\a$ to find the values of $\a$ for which $\xi(0)>-2$.
\begin{align*}
  -\frac{2\lambda}{\a^{p-1}V(0)}>-2\\
  \frac{\lambda}{\a^{p-1}V(0)}<1\\
  \frac{\lambda}{V(0)}<\a^{p-1}\\
  \a > \left[\frac{\lambda}{V(0)}\right]^{\frac{1}{p-1}}
\end{align*}
which is confirmed by the assumption that $\a\in G\cup N$ \# is it?.

Trailing back our steps, we see that $\xi(0)>-2$ which implies $\Xi(0)>0$. For any $\beta\in(0,\bar{\beta})$ we have $$\beta<\Xi(r)\iff\beta(p-1)-2-\xi(r)<0\quad\text{ and vice versa.}$$ 

\# conclude that this verifies the existence of the unique function $\sigma(\beta)$ with the aforementioned properties. that is $\sigma(\beta)$ is continuous and decreasing and $\sigma(0)>0$ and $\sigma(\bar{\beta})=0$ as well as $\sigma(\beta)$ determing the sign of $\phi_\beta(r)$ for all $\beta>0$.

% Now that we have confirmed $\Xi(0)>0$ and $\Xi(r)$ strictly decreasing... \# Let $\Xi(0)=\bar\beta$, \#, for all $\beta\in[0,\bar\beta]$. Note $\Xi(r)$ is continuous and decreasing, so $\sigma(\beta)\coloneqq\left.\Xi(r)^{-1}\right|_{[0,\bar\beta]}$ has properties (a) and (b).\# Also, note $\Xi(0)>0\iff\xi(0)>-2$. \# \# 
% Show that there is an implication from the property of $V(0)$ to the property of $\xi(0)$. By definition? $\xi(0) = 0 * V'(0)/V(0) + 2\lambda / (V(0)*u(0)^{p-1}$... What do I know about $V'(0)?$ And about $V(0)?$ By lemma 5.1 ?? 
% % % % % % % % Also, as $u(0,\a)=\a>0$, we have $\a^{p-1}>0$ and $V(0)>0$ (finite or infinite) implies the second term of $\xi > 0$... Yes, definitely some Lyapunov/lemma 5.1 property involved here. Consider the following cases ......$V(0)<\infty$ .... $V(0)=\infty$ ... hence $\xi(0)>-2$ for $\alpha\in(G\cup N)$.

\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}\label{wq}
For $\alpha\in G\cup N$ the derivative of the solution with respect to the initial condition $w(r,\a)$ has a unique zero $r_0\in(0,z(\alpha)).$ Furthermore, 
\begin{align*}
w(z(\alpha))<0,\quad&\text{ if }\alpha\in N\\
\underset{r\to\infty}{\lim}w(r)=-\infty,\quad&\text{ if }\alpha\in G.
\end{align*}

\begin{proof}
% Some remarks: the functions $u(r)$ and $w(r)$ will be compared `'in the rest of the uniqueness proof'. 
Interpreting the statements in this lemma, we will see that $w(r,\a)$ has a \textbf{unique} zero $r_0$ to the left of $z(\alpha)$, the zero of the solution $u(r,\a)$. When concerned with a ground state solution, $u(r,\a)$ has no finite zero, signified by $z(\alpha)=\infty$. Then still $w(r,\a)$ has a finite zero $r_0\in(0,\infty)$ and $w(r,\a)<0$ for $r>r_0$ and after $r_0$ the function $w(r,\a)$ tends to negative infinity for $r\to\infty$, that is $\underset{r\to\infty}{\lim}w(r)=-\infty$.

Remember that the differential equation in $\nu_{\beta}(r)$ changes sign when equal to a value of $\phi_\beta(r)$. In turn, this function $\phi_\beta(r)$ changes sign in the $r$-value $\sigma(\beta)$. By fixing $\beta=\beta_0$ such that $\rho(\beta)$ and $\sigma(\beta)$ intersect in $\beta_0$ ($\sigma(\beta_0)=\rho(\beta_0)=\rho_0$) we have achieved a crucial step. Certain zeroes related to $\nub(r)$ now coincide because of this choice $\beta=\beta_0$. Remember that $\phi_{\beta_0}$ changes sign in $r=\rho_0$. Which implies that the differential equation in $\nu_{\beta_0}(r)$ changes sign in $\rho_0$. But by the definition of $\nub(r)$, we can see that the zero of $\nub(r)$ now coincides with the sign change of the differential equation: $\rho_0$ is the value in which $\nu_{\beta_0}(r)$ changes sign, since $$\nu_{\beta_0}(\rho_0)=-u(\rho_0)\left\{\theta(\rho_0)-\beta_0\right\}=0.$$ The last equality follows from $\theta(\rho_0)=\beta_0\iff\rho(\beta_0)=\rho_0$ such that $\theta(\rho_0)-\beta_0=0$.

By \# we know that the solution $\nu(r)$ changes sign in $\rho_0\in[0,z(\alpha)]$. $$\nu(z(\alpha))z(\alpha)u'(z(\alpha))<0,$$ the solution $\nu(r)$ changes sign once. \# expand Since by \# $w(r,\a)$ has at least one zero for $\a\in G\cup N$, let $\tau$ be the first zero of $w(r)$. \# setup up the Sturm comparison functions for $w$ and $\nu$ and explain Since $\nu(r)$ oscillates faster than $w(r,\a)$, there will be a zero to the left of $\tau$. That is, $\nu(\rho_0)=0$ with $\rho_0\in(0,\tau)$. 

Also by Sturm comparison, $w$ can have no further zero and $\tau$ is the unique zero of $w$. Suppose that $w$ has a zero with $r_1>r_0$. Then $\nu$ must have a zero between $r_0$ and $r_1$. Yet, $\nu$ has a unique zero $\rho_)$, a contradiction.

`'By previous lemmata' the sign of $\nu$ changes in $\rho_0$.
Refer to lemma ... and/or figure ...
Also, remember ...
$\nu$ changes sign only once
The argument that $\nu$ changes sign only once is given in lemma ...
Remember that ...
$w$ has a first zero
Suppose $w(r)$ does not have a zero.
Then ...
Comparing $w$ and $v$, conclusion: $w$ has a unique zero
One can compare $\nu$ and $w$ with\\ Sturm's comparison theorem,
which is given as ...
In this theorem, take ... as ... and ... as ... to see that ...
Also if $\alpha\in G$
When $\alpha\in G$ then $u(r)$ has no zero.
The solution depends on $\alpha$ and the change of $u(r)$ with respect to $\alpha$ is given by
the function $w(r)=\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}u(r)$.
`'Since there are solutions that have a zero and some that don't',
the function $w(r)$ must have a zero.
Even more, the zero of $w$ will be to the left of the zero of $u(r)$.
CIRKELREDENERING?
Then $u(r)$ does not have a zero, the limit of $w(r)$ for $r$ to infinity is negative infinity.
    To see this, note that for increasing $\alpha$, one will obtain a solution that \emph{has} a zero.
    Hence in that $r$-value, the function $u(r)$ decreases with increasing $\alpha$, ergo,
    the function $w(r)$ is increasingly ?? negative for $r$-values where $u(r)$ is positive.

\begin{lemma}
Let $\alpha^*\in N$.
Then $[\alpha^*,\infty)\subset N\text{ and }z:[\alpha^*,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is monotone decreasing.
\begin{proof}
% \begin{outline}
%   \1 First of all, $N$ is open.
%     \2 To see this, let $\hat\a\in N$.
%     \2 There exists $r_0$ such that $u(r_0;\hat\a)=0$.
%     \2 Let $\hat r> r_0$ then $u(\hat r;\hat\a)<0$.
%     \2 By continuous dependence of $u$ on $\a$, for all $\a$ sufficiently close to $\hat\a$ one has $u(\hat r;\a)<0$.
%     \2 Thus $N$ is open.
%   \1 Secondly, $z:N\to(0,\infty)$ is continuous.
%     \2 For all $\epsilon>0$ there exists a $\delta>0$ such that
% \end{outline}

% \seperate

% \underline{$N$ is open}
Let $\hat\alpha\in N$.
By definition of $N$, there exists a $\hat r>0$ such that $u(\hat r;\hat\alpha)<0$.
By continuous dependence on the initial data [[Cod. Lev.]],
for all $\alpha$ sufficiently close to $\hat\alpha$, $u(\hat r;\alpha)<0$ as well.

% \underline{$z$ is continuous}
By definition of $N$ and continuous dependence on the initial data,
none of the solutions in $N$ can be tangent to the $r$-axis.
Thus $z:N\to(0,\infty)$ is continuous.
% None of these solutions can be tangent to the $r$-axis, \_SHOW
% hence the function $z:N\to(0,\infty)$ is continuous.
% That is...

% \seperate

% \underline{$z$ is decreasing}
Let $\alpha^*\in N$.
Then by \ref{}, $w(z(\alpha^*))<0$ and for
$\epsilon>0$ sufficiently small,
$(\alpha^*,\alpha^*+\epsilon)\subset N$
and $u(z(\alpha^*),\alpha)<0$
for all $\alpha\in(\alpha^*,\alpha^*+\epsilon)$.

Remember that $w$ is the derivative of $u$ with respect to the initial condition.
Since $w(z(\alpha^*))<0$, for initial conditions upward of $\alpha^*$ ($\alpha\in(\alpha^*,\alpha^*+\epsilon)$):
$u(\alpha,z(\alpha^*))<u(\alpha^*,z(\alpha^*))=0$.
By the intermediate value theorem [[Cod. Lev.]], there exists a $r\in(0,z(\alpha^*))$ such that $u(\alpha,r)=0$.
Then $z(\alpha)\leq r\leq z(\alpha^*)$ for all $\alpha\in(\alpha^*,\alpha^*+\epsilon)$.
Conclusion: $z$ is decreasing on $(\alpha^*,\alpha^*+\epsilon)$.

\seperate

\underline{Domain of $z$ extends to infinity}
In fact, $z$ is decreasing on $[\alpha^*,\infty)$.
That is, let $$\bar\alpha\coloneqq\sup\{\alpha>\alpha^*\subset N\text{
and }z:[\alpha^*,\alpha)\to(0,\infty)\text{ is decreasing}\}.$$
Then the lemma requires $\bar\alpha=\infty$.
Suppose by contradiction $\bar\alpha<\infty$.
Then there exists $z(\bar\alpha)\coloneqq\lim_{\alpha\to\bar\alpha}z(\alpha)\in[0,\infty).$
Clearly, $\bar\alpha\in N$, since $u(\bar\alpha,z(\bar\alpha)=0$ by continuity of $z$.
But then $[\bar\alpha,\bar\alpha+\epsilon)\in N$ for $\epsilon>0$ sufficiently small.
This contradicts the definition of $\bar\alpha$ as the supremum.
Then $\bar\alpha=\infty$.
Conclusion: for $\alpha^*\in N$, $[\alpha^*,\infty)\subset N$
and $z:[\alpha^*,\infty)\to(0,\infty)$ is decreasing.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%.     CHAPTER 5.8
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}
Let $\alpha\in G$.
There exists $\epsilon>0$ such that $(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)\subset N$.
\begin{proof}

% {\begin{outline}\raggedbottom
%     	\1 By lemma 5.6, for $\a\in G$, $w$ is unbounded and there exists unique $r_0$ in $(0,\za)$ such that $w(r_0)=0$.
%     	\1 Then by Lemma 6 of Kwong, $r_0\in(d,\infty)$, that is, the unique zero $r_0$ of $w(r)$ on $(0,\za)$ is in the disconjugacy interval $(d,\infty)$ of \ref{} $w$-IVP. USED WHERE?
%     	\1 Let $r_1,r_2$ be such that: $d<r_1<r_0<r_2<\infty$. Since $w(r_1)>0$ and $w(r_2)<0$, there exists $\epsilon>0$ such that for all $\tilde\a\in(\a,\a+\epsilon)$, $$ \tilde u(r_1) > u(r_1) \text{ and } \tilde u(r_2)<u(r_2) $$ where $\tilde u = u(r;\tilde\a)$.
%     	\1 Hence, for given $\tilde\a\in(\a,\a+\epsilon)$, the graph of $\tilde u$ intersects the graph of $u$ at some point $r_3\in(r_1,r_2)$.
%     	\1 Claim: there exists $\tilde r\in(r_3,\infty)$ such that $\tilde u(\tilde r)=0$, thus $\tilde\a\in N$.
%     		\2 Suppose by contradiction that $\tilde u(r)>0$ for all $r>r_3$.
%     		\2 Then $\tilde u(r)<u(r)$ for all $r>r_3$ by the following argument:
%     			\3 Suppose by contradiction that $\tilde u(r_4)=u(r_4)$ for some $r_4>r_3$ and $u-\tilde u>0$ on $(r_3,r_4)$.
%     			\3 Define on $(r_3,r_4)$ function $z\coloneqq u-\tilde u$ that satisfies SHOW: $$ z'' + \frac{1}{r}z' -\lambda z + V(r)\frac{u^p-\tilde u^p}{u-\tilde u}z = 0 $$
%     			\3 Before applying Sturm comparison between $z$ and $w$, let $y$ be a solution to \ref{} $w$-IVP linearly independent of $w$. Then $y$ must vanish somewhere in $(r_3,r_4)$ BY DISCONJUGACY? WHY? STURM COMPARISON WITH Z? QUESTION: DOES ANY SOLUTION TO w-IVP NEED TO YIELD THE SUPPOSED PROPERTIES OF $u$ AND $\tilde u$? PROBABLY NOT.. PROBABLY BY STURM COMPARISON, AS THE COMPARISON BETWEEN $\frac{u^p-\tilde u^p}{u-\tilde u}$ AND $pu^p$ IS MADE!Thus $\{w,y\}$ is a basis of solutions of \ref{} $w$-IVP and it is impossible to find a positive solution on $(d,\infty)$, a contradiction with the supposed property of $z$ !! CHECK !!
%     		\2 Anyway.... The contradiction shows that $z(r)>0$ ($\tilde u(r)<u(r)$) for all $r>r_3$. And $w$-IVP \ref{} is a Sturm majorant of $z$-IVP \ref.
%     		\2 Let $\tilde w$ be a solution to $w$-IVP \ref{} such that $\tilde w(r_3)=0$.
%     			\3 Note that $\tilde w(r_3)=0$ is a completely different solution than the aforementioned $w(r)$.
%     		\2 Since $r_3\in(d,\infty)$ by Lemma 6 in Kwong our $\tilde w$ is unbounded and we can assume that $\tilde w(r)\to+\infty$. Why PLUS infinity? Our $w$ goes to $-\infty$... Does this have to do with linear independence? SHOW
%     		\2 Also $\tilde w>0$ on $(r_3, \infty)$. No solution can vanish more than once in the disconjugacy interval.. SHOW/USE
%     		\2 Then by the strong version of Sturm comparison: $$ \frac{w'(r)}{w(r)}\leq\frac{z'(r)}{z(r)}\text{ for all }r\in(r_3,r_4)$$
%     		\2 Which by integration from $r_4$ to $r$ yields: $$ \ln\tilde w(r)\leq\ln\frac{\tilde w(r_4)}{z(r_4)}+\ln z(r) $$
%     		\2 Now, remember $z\equiv u(r)-\tilde u(r)\to+\infty$ as $r\to\infty$, which is impossible since $0<\tilde u(r)<u(r)$ on $(r_3,\infty)$ and $u(r)\to\infty$! (How could $z\equiv u(r)-\tilde u(r)$ go to infinity if the majorant $u$ goes to zero and the subtrahend is positive everywhere!)
%     		\2 Then the contradiction is reached and $\tilde u(r)$ has a zero for some $r\in(r_3,\infty)$.
%     	\1 Conclusion: $\tilde u$ has a zero so $\tilde\a\in N$.
%     	\1 Since $\tilde\a$ was chosen arbitrarily in $(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)$, all $\a'\in(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)$ have $\alpha'\in N$.

    By chapter 4, the solution set $G$ is non-empty.
    Let $\alpha\in G$ and let $u(r;\alpha)$ be the corresponding solution.
    The function $w(\alpha,r)=\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}u(\alpha;r)$ satisfies \ref.

    \seperate

    By lemma \ref{wq}, the function $w$ is unbounded.
    By lemma \ref{kwong6}, $w$ has a unique zero $r_0\in(d,\infty)$.
    Kwong discusses the disconjugacy interval $(d,\infty)$ of \ref{} in more detail.
    Let $r_1,r_2$ be such that $d<r_1<r_0<r_2$ and note that $w(r_1)>0$ and $w(r_2)<0$.
    There exists $\epsilon>0$ such that, for all $\tilde\alpha\in(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)$,
    $$\tilde u(r_1)>u(r_1)\text{ and }\tilde u(r_2)<u(r_2),$$ where $\tilde u=u(\tilde\alpha,r)$.
    Hence there exists $r_3\in(r_1,r_2)$ such that the graphs of $u$ and $\tilde u$ intersect,
    i.e. $\tilde u(r_3)=u(r_3)$. See also figure \ref{}.

    \seperate

    To conclude $\tilde\alpha\in N$ requires existence of a $\tilde r$ such that $\tilde u(\tilde r)=0$.
    By contradiction, suppose that $\tilde u(r)>0$ for all $r>r_3$.
    (Note that $\tilde u(r)\geq u(r)>0$ on $r\leq r_3$, since $u(r)>0$ for all $r$.)

    Now, for $r>r_3$ and small, $\tilde u(r)<u(r)$.
    Claim: $u(r)>\tilde u(r)$ for all $r>r_3$.
    Define the difference between $u$ and $\tilde u$ as $z\coloneqq u-\tilde u$.
    Note $u(r)>\tilde u(r)\iff z(r)>0$.
    By contradiction, suppose there exists $r_4>r_3$ such that $\tilde u(r_4)=u(r_4)$ (equivalent to $z(r_4)=0$).
    On $(r_3,r_4)$ the function $z$ satisfies:
    % $$z''+\frac{1}{r}z'+\left[V(r)\frac{u^p-\tilde u^p}{u-\tilde u}\right]z = 0 $$
    \begin{align*}
    	&z''+\frac{1}{r}z'+\left[V(r)\frac{u^p-\tilde u^p}{u-\tilde u}\right]z = 0\quad\mathrm{because} \\
    	(1):\quad &u'' + \frac{1}{r}u' -\lambda u + Vu^p = 0 \\
    	(2):\quad &\tilde u'' + \frac{1}{r}\tilde u' -\lambda\tilde u + V\tilde u^p = 0\\
    	(1) - (2):\quad &u'' - \tilde u'' + \frac{1}{r}u' - \frac{1}{r}\tilde u' -\lambda u + \lambda\tilde u + Vu^p - V\tilde u^p = 0\\
    	 &z'' + \frac{1}{r}z' -\lambda z + \left[Vu^p - V\tilde u^p\right]
    	\frac{u-\tilde u}{u-\tilde u} = 0\\
    	 &z'' + \frac{1}{r}z' + \left[V(r)\frac{u^p-\tilde u^p}{u-\tilde u}-\lambda\right]z = 0
    \end{align*}

    \seperate

    %Using Sturm theory, the zeroes of $z$ can be studied.
    %and note that proving $z(r)>0$ on $(r_3,\infty)$ implies $\tilde u(r)<u(r)$ on that interval.
    % This function satisfies the differential equation $$\label{zivp} BLA $$.
    % \\ \\

    Also by Sturm comparison of $z$ and $w$, the latter oscillates faster.
    Let $\tilde w$ be a solution of \eqref{wivp} such that $\tilde w(r_3)=0$.

    \seperate

    By integration of the strong version of Sturm, $z(r)\to\infty$ as $r\to\infty$,
    but this is impossible as $0<\tilde u(r)<u(r)$ on $(r_3,\infty)$ and $u(r)\to0$ as $r\to\infty$.
    Therefore, $\tilde u$ vanishes at some point $\tilde r\in(r_3,\infty)$
    and the proof is complete.

%     \comm{
%     for any $\epsilon>0$, all solutions $\tilde u=u(\tilde\alpha,r)$ with $\tilde\alpha\in(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)$ are non-vanishing. Then  Remember that $w$ is the derivative of \eqref{ivp} with respect to the initial condition. And by \ref{} $w$ has a unique zero that is contained in the disconjugacy interval. [[]] Let $r_1,r_2$ be such that $d<r_1<r_0<r_2$ and note $w(r_1)=\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}u(\alpha;r_1)>0$ and $w(r_2)=\frac{\partial}{\partial\alpha}u(\alpha;r_2)<0$. Let $\epsilon>0$ such that for all $\tilde\alpha\in(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)$, $$\tilde u(r_1)>u(r_1)\text{ and }\tilde u(r_2)<u(r_2),$$ where $\tilde u=u(\tilde\alpha,r)$ and $\tilde\alpha\in(\alpha,\alpha+\epsilon)$. The solutions $u$ and $\tilde u$ intersect in some point $r_3$. THEY STURM COMPARE. RELATION Z=U-UT.}
