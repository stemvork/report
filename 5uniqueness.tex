\comm{Uniqueness is proven by showing solution set $G$ contains at most one point: since $G$ is non-empty by chapter \ref{}, then $G$ contains precisely one point. The first lemma states that any points near a ground state initial condition ($\alpha\in G$) are not ground state. [[how about P?]]}

\begin{lemma}\label{kwong6} (Lemma 6 in \cite{kwong}) Let $(c,\infty)$ be the disconjugacy interval of \eqref{}. Every solution of \eqref{} with a zero in $(c,\infty)$ is unbounded.

Conversely, if the last zero of an unbounded solution of \eqref{} is $\rho$, then $\rho$ is an interior point of the disconjugacy interval. In the other words, $\rho>c$.
