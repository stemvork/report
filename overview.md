## Physics

## Notation and general math

## Existence

## Uniqueness
Lemmata 1 through 7 describe necessary and sufficient results to support the following claim: the solutions to the initial value problem are a disjoint union of positive solutions, negative solutions and a ground state solution. 

## Conclusions
