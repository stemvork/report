\section{Preliminary results for the integral equation}
The problem \eqref{upde} subject to $u\in L^4$ is equivalent to the integral
equation in $L^4$
\be \begin{cases}\label{uint}
    u(x) = \int g(x-y) u^3(y)\diff y,\quad\text{where}\\
    g(x) = (4\pi)^{-1} |x|^{-1} e^{-|x|}. %\# research
\end{cases} \ee 

Here $g(x)$ is the Yukawa (screened Coulomb) potential. This potential 
is associated with the equation
\be\label{yukawa}\Delta u - u = 0.\ee 
We consider radially symmetric solutions to \eqref{yukawa}, $r=|x|$, which solve
\be\label{yukrs}\frac{\diff}{\diff r^2}\left(ru\right)=ru.\ee 
Hence, the Yukawa potential $u(r)$ is of the form $ru = e^{-r}
\iff u(r) = r^{-1}e^{-r}$.

% This is the Yucawa potential. I have downloaded the reference
% Ladyzhenskaya. I have not been able to download the references Nirenberg,
% Friedman, Coffman.

The following two subsections discuss (mostly) standard results regarding the
Sobolev space $H^1$ and the convolution operator $\tau: u \to g\ast u$. 

% Further details can obtained from \#3 and \#14.
% This section summarises results concerning the space $H^1$ and the convolution
% operator $\tau: u\to g\ast u$.

\subsection{Some results regarding $H^1$} 
First, concerning the space $H^1$, we have the following results: 
\begin{enumerate}[a)] 
    \item $C^\infty_0$ is dense in $H^1$.  
    \item If $u\in H^1$, then $v=|u|\in H^1$ and $$|u|_{1,2}=|v|_{1,2}.$$ 
    \item If $u\in H^1$, then $u\in L^4$ and \be|u|_{0,4} \leq 2^{-1/4}|u|_{1,2}.\ee 
    \item Let $V$ denote the subspace of $H^1$ consisting of radially symmetric functions. The embedding $V \to L^4$ is compact.  
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Some results regarding the convolution operator} 
\begin{enumerate}[a)] \setcounter{enumi}{4} 
    \item If $u\in L^{4/3}$, then $v = g\ast u \in H^1\subseteq L^4$, $\int u~v~\mathrm{d} x>0$ unless $u=0$, and $v$ is a weak solution of \be \label{vpde} -\Delta v + v = u. \ee 
    \item If $u \in L^1\cap L^\infty$, then $v = g\ast u$ has bounded continuous
        first derivatives and $$\underset{|x|\to\infty}{\lim} v(x) = 0$$.  
    \item If $u\in L^1\cap L^\infty\cap C^1$, then $v = g\ast u\in
        C^2$ and $v$ satisfies \eqref{vpde}.  
    \item Let $X$ and $Y$ denote the subspaces of $L^{4/3}$ and $L^4$ respectively, consisting of radially symmetric
functions. Then $Y = X^\ast$ and $\tau : X \to Y$ is compact.  
\end{enumerate}
